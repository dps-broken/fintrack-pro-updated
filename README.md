## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   MongoDB (local instance or MongoDB Atlas)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd fintrack-pro
    ```

2.  **Create Environment File:**
    *   Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env` in the root directory:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Update the `.env` file with your MongoDB connection string, JWT secret, email credentials, etc.

3.  **Install Server Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

4.  **Install Client Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

5.  **Update Client Environment (if needed):**
    *   In `client/`, copy `.env.example` (you'll create this) to `.env` and set `REACT_APP_API_URL` (or `VITE_API_URL`) if it's different from the default.

6.  **Run the Application:**

    *   **Start the Backend Server:**
        Open a terminal, navigate to the `server` directory:
        ```bash
        cd server
        npm run dev # (if you have a dev script in server/package.json) or npm start
        ```
        The server should typically run on `http://localhost:5001` (or the port you set in `.env`).

    *   **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
        Open another terminal, navigate to the `client` directory:
        ```bash
        cd client
        npm start # For Create React App
        # or
        # npm run dev # For Vite
        ```
        The client should typically run on `http://localhost:3000`.

7.  **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Scripts

*   **Server:**
    *   `npm start`: Starts the production server.
    *   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with Nodemon (recommended for development).
*   **Client:**
    *   `npm start` (or `npm run dev` for Vite): Starts the React development server.
    *   `npm run build`: Builds the React app for production.
